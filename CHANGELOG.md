# Changelog

One entry per milestone (spec Section 16).

## M1: Shell

- Repo skeleton, `package.json` (scripts only, no dependencies), `.gitignore`, `jsconfig.json` for editor type checks.
- `scripts/check-line-limits.mjs`: fails above 1000 lines and lists files over 600. It runs in `npm test` and CI.
- `serve.mjs`: zero-dependency static dev server with path-traversal protection and a `--lan` option.
- PWA shell:
  - `index.html` with the iOS and Android meta tags
  - the manifest
  - the versioned app-shell service worker, with an update toast that waits for the user
  - icons drawn and PNG-encoded by `scripts/make-icons.mjs`
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
- Hash router with lazy view modules, an in-app back stack and guards against stale renders.
- IndexedDB layer:
  - a promise wrapper with strict-durability writes
  - schema with migrations and validators
  - stamping (ids, `updatedAt` always moving forward, author and device)
  - soft delete, settings, and autosaved form drafts
- Seed data: 12 generic "(example)" tools, 10 templates across every category, and the materials list. Fixed ids for safe merges.
- Settings:
  - name and device
  - tools: add, edit, archive, half-life override
  - template editor: fields, spec properties, reorder, derived outputs, preview, key locking
  - materials, lookup tuning with reset, theme, version and update check
- UI kit:
  - `h()` builder
  - steppers with hold-to-repeat
  - mm:ss duration input
  - segmented choices, switches, toasts with Undo, confirm dialog, bottom sheet, list rows
  - light and dark themes, both meeting AA contrast
- Tests: line limits, schema and seed, record stamping, ids, time, format, PWA shell assets, code conventions.
- Docs: `DATA-MODEL.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `DEPLOY.md`. CI and Pages workflows.
